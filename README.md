# Wave-tank
A wave tank is a laboratory setup for observing the behavior of surface waves. The typical wave tank is a box filled with liquid, usually water, leaving an open or air-filled space on top. At one end of the tank, an actuator generates waves; the other end usually has a wave-absorbing surface.
Usually, these tanks cost a lot of money so I tried to build a  really cheap solution for students who want to use the tank for testing their projects. My college agreed to fund it but by the time they released the money my engineering was already over I had to stay behind extra two weeks to finish it. I ended up doing more work :).

This project is open source I have also documented steps on how to build your own. I hope this will help someone like me who does not have proper resource but still want to build cool stuff and if you watch the last video you might see young me explaining all the different parts of the tank and how to operate it.
